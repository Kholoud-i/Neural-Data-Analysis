## The Data
CRCNS - Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience - hc3 dataset (Spikes, Local Field Potential)
Multi-unit recordings from the rat hippocampus made during open field foraging (contributed by Gyorgy Buzs√°ki lab, New York University).
The data set contains recordings made from multiple hippocampal areas in Long-Evans rats, including: Cornu Ammonis: CA1 and CA3; dentate gyrus (DG), and entorhinal cortex: EC2, EC3, EC4, EC5. The data was obtained during 442 recording sessions and includes responses of 7,737 neurons in eleven animals while they performed one of fourteen behaviors. Total time for all experiments is 204.5 hours. The raw (broadband) data was recorded at 20KHz, simultaneously from 31 to 127 channels. The raw data was processed to extract the LFPs (Local Field Potentials) and detect spikes.
## The Analysis
Skills involved: Signal Processing; Statistical Analysis; MATLAB Programming. I
Worked with Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience hc3 dataset (Spikes, LFP)
I Utilized MATLAB to build a bandpass filter to detect ripples from LFP, then 
implemented selection of math/stat methods (envelope estimation, welch's power spectral density estimation, hilbert transform).
Analyzed 180 GB of LFP data across 64 channels & combined computations into a function that detected ripples in hippocampus, and Lined up ripples with spikes.
